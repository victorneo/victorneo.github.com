### A Need For Continuous Learning

[Continuous learning](http://chronicle.com/blognetwork/castingoutnines/2012/06/13/continuous-learning-instead-of-lifelong-learning/),
or lifelong learning, is far from a new concept for most engineers. Given how
fast the software engineering field moves everyday, we can only keep up by
learning (at our own comfortable pace). Of course, it is not ideal to restrict
learning to only technical domains. Any continuous learning plan should allow
you to learn new knowledge that may be indirectly useful in life.

Having graduated from NTU in December 2013, I am currently working at
[Carousell](https://carousell.co/) as their Lead Engineer where I focus
primarily on the backend and system infrastructure. Moving from a structured
studying curriculum to a working environment which is largely unstructured, I
tried several techniques to introduce opportunities for learning throughout the
day, as opposed to only learning during a dedicated time period.

Here are a collection of methods and news sources that I have personally tried and stuck with
after a few months. I would love to know your opinion and comments on them on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/victorneo/).

### Social Media and News

Social media can often a huge time sink. You spend time posting status updates,
reading and replying to your best friend's shared posts and media,
participating in viral loops... etc. From another perspective, the huge inflow
of information actually allows one to learn and discuss about new ideas more
rapidly than reading them in the wild. In contrast with Facebook, Twitter
actually makes it easier for you the filter and read interesting or
thought-provoking updates from other engineers.

- [Twitter lists](https://support.twitter.com/articles/76460-using-twitter-lists#) is an
awesome tool to curate your own set of technical newsfeed from specific users
on Twitter that is separate from your own timeline (which may contain, say pet
photos from your friends). Having a list makes it easy to consume these bite
size updates while commuting on the bus or train. Whenever I chance upon
tidbits of new tools or thoughts by certain users that sound interesting, I can
favourite the tweet which would be akin to bookmarking for me to research more
in-depth at a more convenient time.
- Without any newsfeed curation tool,
[Facebook Groups](https://www.facebook.com/about/groups) is perhaps the
only way to learn of new tools on Facebook itself. Two key factors are at play
here: the quality of the group's posting and the type of discussion that
generates from these posts. In general, it is important to join multiple groups
covering different topics to avoid the [Echo Chamber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_chamber_%28media%29) effect.
Some of the groups that is more active in Singapore are
[HackerspaceSG](https://www.facebook.com/groups/hackerspacesg/) and [Front End
Developers Singapore](https://www.facebook.com/groups/frontendsingapore/).

Twitter and Facebook groups actually complement each other for learning -
Twitter for smaller updates and Facebook for more in-depth discussion.

My source of technical news in the post [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/) era is limited to:

- [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) and Reddit's [/r/programming](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming):
Major technical news topics often pop up on these two sites first. Readers of
these sites, including myself, generally agree that the comments section is the
most valuable. However, being on the internet means that some of the comments
can be unhelpful or plain snobbish.
- [LWN.net](http://lwn.net/) covers Linux
information from the source (literally). I do not claim to understand every
topic covered, but the site is a great treasure trove of Linux news and
information I can learn from.

### Podcasts

Apart from reading, commute time is great for both listening and watching
podcasts. On my HTC One, I use
[AntennaPod](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.danoeh.antennapod)
to subscribe and download podcasts. Some of the podcasts I listen and watch
include:

- [The Changelog](http://thechangelog.com/podcast/):
Changelog is an awesome podcast which focuses on Open Source and the people
behind them. Guests who uses or develops open source libraries used mostly in
production settings are invited to share their background, experience and
opinion on topics such as managing open source projects, etc.
- [BBC Globalnews](http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/globalnews):
No introduction needed for BBC news. It is a simple way to catch up on global
news while on the go.
- [The Linux Action Show](http://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/tag/linux-action-show/):
Another personal favourite of mine. As the name of the podcast suggests, it is
a Linux focused podcast which covers a myriad of topics ranging from Distro
reviews to interviews with people behind the scenes.

### MOOCs

Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs) is best at providing a semi-structured
learning environment for different types of topics. I personally do not
participate in any of the courses (tests and exams) but instead view the
lecture videos for learning on the go. If you have the time and capacity to do
so, taking the tests and exams would definitely grant you a better
understanding of the subject matter. However, the beauty of MOOCs is such that
with the materials provided, one can customize and adapt learning of new topics
according to his or her pace. There are tools which allows you to easily
download lecture videos and their corresponding lecture materials.

Some of the courses I am preparing to take soon are:

- [Analysis of Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/course/aofa):
This courses provides an "introduction to analytic combinatorics in the context
of applications in the analysis of algorithms". What stands out for this course
is that it goes beyond our O / Omega  notation style of algorithm analysis by
introducing a calculus that lets us precisely understand and compare the
performance of algorithms.
- [Classics of Chinese Humanities: Guided Readings](https://www.coursera.org/course/chinesehumanities):
I have been waiting for this course to launch for quite a while! Despite having
a bilingual curriculum in our pre-tertiary education, there is almost no chance
for one to learn topics taught in our second language in the University (apart
from taking language-based degree courses and electives). It should be
refreshing to read these classics and to take a course in Mandarin.


### Team / Company Sharing Sessions

Learning is crucial at the workplace too! This is why we have started sharing
sessions at Carousell to enable us to learn from each other. We do our best to
make the session fun and interesting so that everyone walks away with a better
understanding of a new topic.

Topics that we have covered so far include a gentle introduction to our
infrastructure as well as an analysis of support emails that we get from our
users. After our sharing session on support email analysis, we were able
identify and build new features for our internal support tools to help out
community and user support team in their daily work. 


### Going Forward

I pretty excited over how my current continuous learning plans will work out in
the long run. MOOCs give me the structured classroom feel for discipline and
podcasts + news makes commute much more bearable as they are now learning
sessions.

If you have your own ideas of how you are all setup for learning, I would be
happy to [hear them](https://twitter.com/victorneo/).
