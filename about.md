### The writer

I am Victor, a software engineer based in Singapore, a country that is very
likely to be smaller than the city you are staying in. Armed with nothing
but a computer science degree from [Nanyang Technological
University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg) , I do my best to stay afloat in this
industry.

### Interests

During my student days, I have had the pleasure of working on undergraduate
research projects that allowed me to explore areas in Natural Language
Processing, Information Retrieval and Data Mining. These are fun subjects
that I occasionally spend time on for my own personal projects.

Scheme (or to be more accurate, Racket) was my first foray into functional
programming and it has sparked a little revolution within me. While I still
work with Python on a daily basis at work, I have begun to learn Clojure
and hope to be able to use it more frequently once I have mastered the basics.

Take away my laptop and you will find me stuck with one of my game consoles:
either handhelds or TV ones. A short list of consoles I currently play with:

- Playstation 3
- Playstation Vita
- Nintendo 3DS
